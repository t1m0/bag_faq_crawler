      "Answer: You can have the vaccination if you have an allergy to food, pollen, house dust mites, animals, insect venom, latex or medications other than the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. You can have the vaccination even if you have had a strong reaction to another vaccine in the past. This is because each vaccine and each drug has different components that do not always lead to an allergic reaction.\n",

      "Answer: The vaccine is injected into the upper arm. Two doses are required. The second injection is performed about four weeks after the first. The same vaccine must be used for both injections. Both doses are necessary in order to provide protection.\n",

      "Answer: Around two weeks after the first dose of vaccine there is already some protection from getting the disease. Nevertheless, it’s important to have both vaccinations. Only then are you protected as well as possible from the disease.\n",

      "Answer: No, you’re free to choose where you go for the vaccination. The tariff agreement is valid all over Switzerland. So the vaccination is independent of your place of residence or the place you’re receiving ongoing treatment.\n",

      "Question: Is the vaccination still recommended if I’ve already had the new coronavirus?\n",
      "Answer: Yes. We recommend you get vaccinated even if you have already had the new coronavirus. It is not yet clear how long you are protected after you have had the disease. The data suggests that you are protected from renewed infection for at least three months. For this reason vaccination is also recommended if you have already contracted the coronavirus, but only once three months have elapsed since you had the disease. The vaccination provides optimum protection and gives your immune system an additional boost.\n",

      "Question: What is COVID arm?\n",
      "Answer: COVID arm describes the redness and swelling, sometimes over a large area, that can affect the arm where the vaccine has been injected. If these reactions occur around the injection site, in most cases it’s a week or so after the vaccination. They have been observed more frequently after vaccination with the Moderna vaccine. According to the latest findings, these reactions occur in around 8 in 1,000 people after the first dose of vaccine. They occur in around 2 out of 1,000 vaccinated people after the second dose.\n",

      "Question: Who is liable for any vaccination damage?\n",
      "Answer: The usual liability rules that apply to other medicinal products and vaccines also apply to the COVID-19 vaccination. Liability for vaccination damage could fall to the vaccine manufacturer (product liability), the vaccination centre (agent’s contract liability or state liability) or, on a subsidiary basis, the federal government.\n",

      "Question: How long after the vaccination can side effects occur?\n",
      "Answer: Generally any side effects can be expected in the first 6 months after the vaccination. However, most side effects occur shortly after the vaccination. As a rule they are mild and last only a short time. Similar to the side effects of other vaccinations, these are mostly reactions at the injection site (pain in particular, but also redness and swelling) or general symptoms (such as fatigue, headache, aching muscles and joints or fever).\n",

      "Answer: The proof of vaccination contains the location and date of the vaccination as well as information on the vaccine administered (trade name, manufacturer, batch number). It may also be signed and stamped and may feature the name of the professional who administered the vaccine. The proof of vaccination can vary depending on the cantonal regulations and vaccination centre requirements.\n",

      "Question: What certificate will I receive after the COVID-19 vaccination? Is this an official national/international document? \n",
      "Answer: The vaccination locations (vaccination centre, medical practice, pharmacy) decide how vaccinations are documented. In most cases, you will receive printed proof of vaccination after you have been vaccinated. The proof of vaccination contains the location and date of the vaccination and information on the vaccine administered (trade name, manufacturer, batch number).\n",

      "Question: What is currently known about the efficacy and safety of the vaccines?\n",
      "Answer: The vaccine manufacturers have carried out studies on the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. The results of the studies indicated an effective  protection against falling ill with Covid-19 of 94 percent or more. The vaccines were also shown to provide good protection for older people and people with chronic conditions, preventing them from contracting the disease or resulting in only mild symptoms if they do contract it.\n",

      "Question: Can an mRNA vaccine change my genetic material (DNA/genes)?\n",
      "Answer: No. The mRNA administered with the vaccination is unable to reach the nucleus and incorporate itself in the human genome (DNA/genes). Furthermore, both the mRNA from the vaccine and the proteins produced in the cells are quickly broken down by the body once more. This is because by this time the body has already launched the required immune response and the mRNA and the proteins are no longer needed to protect the body against the coronavirus.\n",

      "Question: What must I do if I have the impression that I am experiencing side effects from the COVID-19 vaccination? \n",
      "Answer: Slight side effects will generally disappear after a few days. But if you still have side effects after a week or the side effects are getting worse, if you feel unwell for a longer period of time after the vaccination or if you notice something unusual a few weeks after the vaccination, you should consult your doctor.\n",

      "Answer: According to the findings of the clinical trials, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (Comirnaty®) provides 95 per cent protection from contracting coronavirus disease. These trial results are confirmed by initial findings from the vaccination campaign in Israel published at the end of January 2021:\n",

      "Answer: At present, the vaccination is only earmarked for specific, prioritised target groups (e.g. people deemed to be at especially high risk). Moving forwards, the vaccination will also be available for other target groups. This will be dependent on the availability of the vaccines.\n",

      "Answer: The trials for the Moderna vaccine were done with people aged 18 and over. At the moment the relevant study data isn’t available for younger people. This is why the vaccine is approved for people aged 18 and over. When more data for other age groups is available it will be possible to adapt the age restrictions for approval accordingly.\n",

      "Question: What are the tasks of Swissmedic?\n",
      "Answer: Swissmedic, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, is responsible for the authorisation and monitoring of vaccines in Switzerland. Swissmedic assesses the efficacy, safety and quality of vaccines. If these criteria are assured, Swissmedic will grant market authorisation for a vaccine to be used in Switzerland.\n",

      "Question: Who decides on priorities for vaccination if sufficient doses of the vaccine are not available initially?\n",
      "Answer: The cantons are allotted quotas according to their population size, on the basis of which they can order vaccinations for their canton. The cantons (and thus also cantonal health personnel) individually decide on a cantonal vaccination strategy and prioritization model. In order for this to occur in a more or less consistent manner across Switzerland, the Federal Vaccination Commission and the FOPH have jointly recommended a prioritization model.\n",

      "Question: Are all the medical incidents occurring shortly after a vaccination connected with the vaccination?\n",
      "Answer: No, not all the medical incidents occurring shortly after a vaccination are connected with the vaccination. Acute medical problems can occur at any time, sometimes also in direct temporal relation to a vaccination. This does not mean, however, that these incidents are necessarily a result of the vaccination. The risk of a severe side-effect from the vaccination is much smaller than the risk of a complication of the coronavirus from which the vaccination protects.\n",
